          <h2>Library Services During and After the Pandemic</h2>
          <h3>The Role of Library Technology Services</h3>
        <h4><br />Sam Popowich<br />June 9, 2020</h4>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left">The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting academic libraries with new challenges that will require us to
change how we provide service and access to our collections. What do you see as the priorities for
Library Technology Services in its efforts to support the Library and the Carleton community in both the
short- and long-term?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Main points to consider:</h3>
          <ul><li>Planning and Prediction</li>
              <li>Labour and Opportunity Costs</li>
              <li>Technical Fixes and Organizational Solutions</li>
              <li>Short Term and Long Term</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">Priorities are never singular or
            hierarchical; they are always balancing acts, so when I
            think of priorities, I think of what elements need to be
            balanced. I have framed these priorities as pairs to
            indicate that.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Planning and Prediction</h3>
          <img src="img/planning.jpg" height="300" style="border:0"/>
          <aside class="notes">
          Difficult to predict what society
          will look like, therefore what role libraries are going to
          play. However, Library Technology Services can adopt
          approaches will will help support flexible planning that is
          able to quickly change direction. Key supports: modularity,
          interoperability, agility. In terms of prediction, LTS is
          well-positioned to contribute in terms of longer-term trends
          (e.g. federated identity, decentralized work, etc)</class>

        <section>
          <h3>Labour and Opportunity Costs</h3>
          <img src="img/scale.png" height="300" style="border:0"/>
          <aside class="notes">
          One way to understand library
          systems' relationship to the rest of the organization is to
          take a political economy approach and understand technology as
          stored-up labour. Library technology services can help
          determine when it makes sense for technology to take over from
          living labour, allowing library workers to do other things. In
          other words, library technology services helps reduce
          opportunity costs.</aside>

          <h3>Labour and  Opportunity Costs</h3>
          <img src="img/carleton.jpg" height="300" style="border:0"/>
          <aside class="notes">
          But this applies to the campus
          community as well. Ranganathan's fourth law - save the time of
          the reader - applies here. But we have to understand the
          opportunity costs in this case as well: is saving time and
          energy justified by pedagogical concerns? I think Library
          Technology Services are often expert at weighing these kinds
          of costs, because we trade off stored up and living labour all
          the time.</aside>

          <h3>Technical Fixes and Organizational Solutions</h3>
          <img src="img/galileo.jpg" height="300" style="border:0"/>
          <aside class="notes">
          On the other hand, Library
          Technology Services is not just technical support. Sometimes
          LTS can provide a technological fix, but that won't solve
          organizational problems. These problems are bound to become
          more acute in a post-pandemic landscape, so LTS can help
          distinguish what is a proper technological problem with a
          technological solution, and what is really an organizational
          problem.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Short Term</h3>
          <ul style="font-size:24pt"><li style="padding-bottom: 25px"><strong>Electronic
                Resources:</strong> Expand access to digital collections (HathiTrust ETAS,
              Internet Archive NEL, E-book discoverability, reserves).</li>
            <li  style="padding-bottom: 25px"><strong>Physical Resources:</strong> Support reopening of physical collection (checkout
                machines, circulation rules, ILS notifications, pickup
                bookings
                etc.)</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 25px"><strong>Access:</strong> Provide or extend off-campus access to different
                constituencies.</li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 25px"><strong>Communication:</strong> Enable and ensure best information management and
                communication practices across all online library
                platforms.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Long Term</h3>
          <ul><li>Digitization and interoperability (data, UX)</li>
              <li>Digital divide</li>
              <li>Digital scholarship</li>
              <li>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">All of these long term trends can be
            thought of both as technological issues and user-experience
            ones, and it's important to bear both those aspects in mind.
            In my view, the biggest technical obstacle to LTS support
            for the library and the campus 
            is data interoperability, which I see, perhaps unusually as
            User-Experience Related. Inconsistency across multiple
            systems is very jarring UX, especially when the underlying
            systems are more-or-less black boxes. In a time of crisis,
            the less "cognitive load" you can place on users in terms of
            UX the better. There is also the question of efficiency of
            discovery which is vitally important when looking for, say,
            health information or government updates.

            Digital divide has been a longstanding problem, and is only
            going to become more acute as more workers and students are
            working remotely, and as relationship with the university
            becomes more and more virtualized and decentralized. There
            needs to be a holistic approach, to be sure, but LTS has a
            critical role to play here.

            Digital scholarship. There's always been a productive
            ambiguity here between scholarship *of the digital* and
            scholarship *done digitally*, and I think this ambiguity
            opens up space to rethink some services - both public facing
            and technological - in a pandemic and post-pandemic period.

            EDI: Here is where intersectionality comes in. The pandemic
            in conjunction with anti-racist movements across the world
            are making it vitally important that we understand the
            potential inequalities baked into our technological
            policies, especially as we start to rely more and more on
            technological solutions to the problems mentioned above, and
            as there is an urge to move very quickly. Even seemingly
            innocuous policies (mention CCID block policy) can have
            structural inequalities of race or gender built in. The
            pandemic and Black Lives Matter movement are providing us
            with an opportunity to reconceive the bases of our
            technology policies and uses.</aside>
